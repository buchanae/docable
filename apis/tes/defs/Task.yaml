title: Task
description: |-
  A Task is a unit of work, including input files
  to be downloaded, a sequence of containers and commands to run,
  and output files to be uploaded to storage.

  Task also includes state (queued, running, complete, etc),
  and logs (stdout, stderr, start/end time, etc).


example:
  id: "batvkihkq10g008vc8u0"
  name: Example task
  state: QUEUED
  inputs:
  - url: s3://my-bucket/examples/my-example.txt
    path: /inputs/input.txt

  outputs:
  - url: s3://my-bucket/examples/output/stdout.txt
    path: /outputs/stdout.txt
  - url: s3://my-bucket/examples/output/stderr.txt
    path: /outputs/stderr.txt

  volumes:
  - /tmp

  volumes:
    description: |-
      Volumes are directories which may be used to share data between
      Executors. Volumes are initialized as empty directories by the
      system when the task starts and are mounted at the same path
      in each Executor.

      For example, given a volume defined at "/vol/A",
      executor 1 may write a file to "/vol/A/exec1.out.txt", then
      executor 2 may read from that file.

      (Essentially, this translates to a `docker run -v` flag where
      the container path is the same for each executor).
