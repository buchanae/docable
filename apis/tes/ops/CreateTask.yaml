      volumes:
        description: |-
          Volumes are directories which may be used to share data between
          Executors. Volumes are initialized as empty directories by the
          system when the task starts and are mounted at the same path
          in each Executor.

          For example, given a volume defined at "/vol/A",
          executor 1 may write a file to "/vol/A/exec1.out.txt", then
          executor 2 may read from that file.

          (Essentially, this translates to a `docker run -v` flag where
          the container path is the same for each executor).
